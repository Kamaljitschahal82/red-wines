The variable "X" is not mentioned in the text file describing the dataset. A quick look at the dataframe reveals that it is just a unique id for every observation. It may be useful later, so we can keep it but change the name in order to avoid confusion.

```{r}
reds <- rename(reds, c("X"="id"))
str(reds)
```

It looks like all free.sulfur.dioxide and total.sulfur.dioxide values are whole numbers. It turns out this is true except for a few cases within each variable, all of them having exactly half a unit more:

```{r}
with(reds, subset(free.sulfur.dioxide, free.sulfur.dioxide %% 1 != 0))
with(reds, subset(total.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide %% 1 != 0))
```

My guess is that this is due to these two variables being measured in (mg / dm^3), while the rest are in (g / dm^3). I suppose that more precision is not needed and/or impossible to measure with the available resources.

```{r}
summary(reds)
```

There are some variables with possible outliers: volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, chlorides, free and total.sulfur.dioxide and sulphates have maximum valures that are far away from the third quartile.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?



# Bivariate Plots Section

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.
